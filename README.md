### ðŸ“Š Interpretation

This graph demonstrates the progressive decline in preload (expressed as percentage reduction from baseline) during 15 months of simulated exposure to spaceflight gravitational conditions.

- **Red Line (0G)**: Shows rapid initial preload decline, stabilizing near ~40% by month 12. This aligns with known fluid redistribution and cardiovascular deconditioning during extended microgravity.
- **Blue Line (0.38G)**: Indicates more gradual reduction, plateauing around ~25%. Suggests Martian gravity provides partial physiological mitigation of cardiac unloading.
- These results were generated using time-resolved COMSOL simulations and validated against bedrest analog and ISS fluid shift data.

**Relevance**: Preload decline is a critical determinant of diastolic dysfunction and ventricular atrophy in long-duration missions. This plot supports development of targeted pre-habilitation strategies and countermeasure testing.
